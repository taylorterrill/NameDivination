## Description

The Name Divination application takes a user's name as an input and returns information about the user based on their name.
The information is pulled from four different server-side APIs. The Agify API guesses the user's age, the Genderize API guesses their gender, Nationalize guesses the user's country of origin, and the Mashape Community Urban Dictionary API pulls a definition of the user's name.
